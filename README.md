## Running the Website
Before you can rush in, confirm you have Python 3.11.xx (I have 3.11.3) and all the dependency are in the virtualenviroment. 
Next create the tables in the terminal, or if you are lazy, run the app.py two times (the data will duplicate, if you don't care) and the server is up. Copy the localhost and enjoy
